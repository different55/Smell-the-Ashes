# Smell the Ashes

[Mod for Vintage Story](https://mods.vintagestory.at/smelltheashes) that makes fires burn down to ashes instead of into empty air.

Adds a new layered ash block. Ash blocks currently drop no items when broken and have no use.

Also makes burnable blocks drop ashes (slower burning blocks drop more ash) when they burn out completely.

Instead of disappearing under mysterious circumstances, your flower patch will now leave behind a thin layer of ashes when struck by lightning. Peat fields leave behind charred landscape instead of holes. Houses leave behind blackened debris. All your ashiest dreams will come true.

**Full disclosure:** This mod was made with AI to test out the capabilities of the new Gemini 3 model that just dropped. It made a heavy handful of mistakes, but it did a good enough job, especially in the research stage, that I didn't just throw everything out. Most of BlockAsh.cs is still entirely AI-authored, and the AI mostly just ripped off BlockLayered.cs for it.

**BEFORE INSTALLING:** This mod comes with one free set of Consequences. Ashes negatively affect the way fire spreads, especially downwards. Peat fires only ever scorch the surface layer. A kitchen fire in the top floor of your wooden skyscraper probably won't burn down the whole building. This mod tries to limit its interference in other people's business, and that makes this problem difficult to avoid.
